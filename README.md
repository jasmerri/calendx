Enjoy a calendar powered by the newest World Wide Web technology!<br>
Github Pages found [here](https://jasmerri.github.io/calendx/web/index.html).<br>
Currently, you can create events that repeat from 1 to 7 times a week, with arbitrary colors, and switch between month and week view.<br>
The formatting of the calendar is dynamically generated, but currently advancing between months is unavailable.
